# js-samples

## Description

Samples for the Google Maps JavaScript API.

The samples can be demoed on the [GitHub demo page](https://googlemaps.github.io/js-samples/dist/) or at the [official documentation site](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples).

## Initialize an app from a sample
```
# install the package
npm i -g @googlemaps/js-samples

# extract a sample to a destination folder
googlemaps-js-samples init map-simple destFolder

# run the sample
cd destFolder
npm i
npm run dev
```

Replace `map-simple` with the path to another sample in this repository.

## Development

### Build

1. `npm i` Install dependencies.
1. `npm run build` Build all targets and update `dist/` folder.

### Test

1. `npm run lint` Optionaly fix lint issues with `npm run format`
1. `npm test` Test outputs.

### Run

1. Start a server with all samples using `npm start` or `bazel run serve` (or `ibazel` for faster live reload)
1. Start a specific sample with `bazel run samples/map-simple:devserver` (or `ibazel` for faster live reload)

### Caching

It may be possible to enable remote caching with Bazel to speed builds. This will require running `gcloud auth application-default login`. This requires access to a specific GCS bucket that most developers do not have.

## Inputs and outputs

The following table identifies the inputs and outputs.
